                            <p class="pxp-text-light">Blockchain allows safe storage of the candidate's profile data through many interconnected systems and helps your company to use it in the further hiring process. Also, Orangeslip, our blockchain-powered platform, is decentralized and eliminates intermediaries that make your employee data management secure.</p>
                            <p class="pxp-text-light">Several companies often can't find the old data records of the candidate who interviewed for their company but didn't join. In that case, Orangeslip can be a reliable option. It is because you can save the data as employee records.</p>
