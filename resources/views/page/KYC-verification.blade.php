                            <p class="pxp-text-light">It is a fact that only skills and experience aren't enough nowadays to hire a candidate. Of course, skills and experience are crucial, but besides that, it is necessary to conduct KYC employment verification to ensure the candidate's authenticity.</p>
                            <p class="pxp-text-light">If you have an open job position at your company and are looking for the best candidate to fill the role, you will likely collect multiple resumes from eager potential employees to review. To ensure his/her experience, it is obvious to conduct KYC verification. Why? With this, the company will be sure that the candidate they are willing to onboard in their company is genuine with their skills and abilities.</p>
                            <p class="pxp-text-light">But unfortunately, due to several everyday tasks, HR doesn't carry out the verifications properly. No more worries, though. Orangeslip may carry out the KYC verification on your behalf, give reviews on potential employees and handle the rest.</p>
